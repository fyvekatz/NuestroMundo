        The MarkupGrid object. For this example, the MarkupGrid component will contain
        "MarkupGridItem" objects, which will be the individual grid item containers.
        The MarkupGridItem objects define what will be displayed to the user when content
        is loaded to the MarkupGrid.

        For this example, we will also set the number of columns and number of rows in
        the MarkupGrid. An important detail here is that depending on the amount of content
        that is passed to the MarkupGrid object, there can be less columns than specified
        explicitly in the numColumns field. There can also be a case where the amount of
        rows can be more or less than what is specified explicitly in the numRows field.
        In other words, the content will first be displayed based on the amount of columns
        specified in the numColumns field, then wrap the rest of the content into another
        row and continue to display content in this fashion.

        It is also important for MarkupGrid objects to set the itemSize field because the
        grid will visually not be seen, but will exist in the channel.

        In this example, we will also disable the focus ring that surrounds the focused
        MarkupGridItem object within the MarkupGrid.

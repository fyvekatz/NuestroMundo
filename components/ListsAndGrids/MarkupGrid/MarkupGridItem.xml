    This component will create a MarkupGridItem node to be used by the
    MarkupGrid node in the MarkupGridExample component. This was specified
    in the "itemComponentName" field of the MarkupGrid component.

    The responsibility of this node is to specify the layout of the
    individual tiles within the MarkupGrid.

    The "itemContent" and "focusPercent" fields are special fields that
    will be updated by the MarkupGrid component. The "itemContent" field
    contains the data that the MarkupGridItem object can use to modify
    how it will be displayed in the MarkupGrid component. The "focusPercent"
    field is a read-only float value that indicates the time delay after focus
    has moved from one MarkupGridItem object to another. This is represented as
    float values between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is having no focus and 1.0 is
    having complete focus on the MarkupGridItem object.

    Other special fields and their functions/behaviors can be found at:

        component.

        The PosterGrid object.

        Each individual item will display certain information based on the metadata of the
        content passed to the PosterGrid. In this example, the content retrieved will specify
        a field called "HDPOSTERURL", which is data bounded to display a poster in the PosterGrid
        based on the url of this field. Other content metadata data bindings for PosterGrid
        content can be found here:
        https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/PosterGrid#PosterGrid-DataBindings

        For this example, we will set the number of columns and number of rows in
        the PosterGrid. An important detail here is that depending on the amount of content
        that is passed to the PosterGrid object, there can be less columns than specified
        explicitly in the numColumns field. There can also be a case where the amount of
        rows can be more or less than what is specified explicitly in the numRows field.
        In other words, the content will first be displayed based on the amount of columns
        specified in the numColumns field, then wrap the rest of the content into another
        row and continue to display content in this fashion.

        It is also important for PosterGrid objects to set the basePosterSize field because
        the grid will visually not be seen, but will exist in the channel.

    This component will create a ListPanel node example. This is different
    from previous examples due to the use of the "extends" field, as this
    will inherit all the properties (such as fields) from the component
    being extended from. However, the user can override functions and
    field values in order to customize the behavior of this custom
    component. In this case, we want different behavior for the "ListPanelExample"
    component than the built-in "ListPanel" component.

        In this example, we will only have the ListPanel contain a
        LabelList node with content.

            For this example, we will have the "container" ContentNode define
            a role. A role is used to set a field of the node's parent. In this
            case, the LabelList's content field will be set to the "container"

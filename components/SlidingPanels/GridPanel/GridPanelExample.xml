    This component will create a GridPanel node example. This is different
    from previous examples due to the use of the "extends" field, as this
    will inherit all the properties (such as fields) from the component
    being extended from. However, the user can override functions and
    field values in order to customize the behavior of this custom
    component. In this case, we want different behavior for the "GridPanelExample"
    component than the built-in "GridPanel" component.
 -->
<component name="GridPanelExample" extends="GridPanel" initialFocus="exampleGridPanel" >
<!--
    This example won't use the user-created "gridContent" field,
    but will be used for the PanelSet example. By setting this
    field, it will trigger the callback function "updateGridContent".
-->
  <interface>
    <field id="gridContent" type="node" onChange="updateGridContent" />
  </interface>

  <script type="text/brightscript" uri="pkg:/components/SlidingPanels/GridPanel/GridPanelExample.brs" />

  <children >
    
    <!--
        In this example, we will only have the GridPanel contain a
        PosterGrid node. We will also specify some fields within
        the PosterGrid.

        For more information about PosterGrids, refer to the PosterGrid
        example in pkg:/components/ListsAndGrids/PosterGrid
    -->
    <PosterGrid 
              id="examplePosterGrid"
              basePosterSize="[ 512, 288 ]"
              numColumns="2"
              numRows="5"
              itemSpacing="[ 20, 20 ]" />

      <!--
          This label changes text based on the title of the content
          node's children. This content node was retrieved by a task
          node that returns a "master" content node which has children
          containing metadata that can be used to replace the text in
          this label node.

          Task nodes are used to run a specific task on a different thread
          asynchronously while the render thread and main thread are running.
          This is useful for fetching data from a server without having to
          make the render thread wait on the data, for example. There are
          also certain Brightscript functions and components that cannot be
          run in SceneGraph components or nodes, and can only be done on task
          nodes. Refer to https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/BrightScript+Support
          for more information.

# Nuestro Mundo
Tabled for the the moment, this is a channel for the Roku platform that will eventually stream all available TV stations in Central America though at the moment, I have started with Costa Rica. An earlier v .1 version of the channel was fully functional and is now going through a UI rework now that I have familiarized myself with the Roku SDK

Built from a standard template, the [Brightscript](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/language/brightscript-language-reference.md) code that I have written is located in the components directory.
